recipeinstructions:
- "Slice bacon into 1cm pieces. Thinly slice onions or leeks, and roughly chop cabbage into bite-size pieces."
- "Heat about 1 Tablespoon olive oil in a heavy pot or sauce pan. Add bacon and onions/leeks until bacon begins to curl."
- "Add 400 ml (1 2/3 US cups) to the pot and bring to a simmer."
