recipeinstructions:
- "Add the olive oil and garlic cloves to a small pot and put it on low heat. Cook gently for about 15 to 20 minutes until the garlic takes on a bit of colour, then add the pepper flakes. Continue cooking until the garlic turns light brown and very soft. Take the pot off the heat. Using a fork, smash the garlic into the oil."

Do so one at a time, and really break them up in your hand as you drop them in. Add a few grinds of black pepper, then bring the sauce to a simmer. Let cook for 30 to 40 minutes until thick and rich. Adjust the seasoning as required. If needed, stir in the sugar to boost the sweetness of the sauce. Turn the pan down to low."
- "Add the basil to the sauce, tearing any large leaves up by hand. Stir in the butter and grated parmesan. The sauce should really come together at this point. Boil the pasta of your choice, and once cooked, drag the noodles into the sauce. Toss, then serve with extra grated parmesan on the side."
