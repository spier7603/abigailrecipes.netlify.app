- "Once pasta is cooled, add the bottle of Italian dressings do the balsamic, mix. Chop salami slices like a pizza, squared. Cut in half, then strips, then pieces. Cut pepperoni into quarters.

It&#39;s the perfect food after a night of adult beverages, because all you need to do is spoon it into a bowl and eat. It&#39;s hearty enough to be a meal in and of itself. Also perfect to throw together and make for a bbq or backyard summer party. A very versatile dish and flavor for days. ENJOY!"
