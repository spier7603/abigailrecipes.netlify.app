recipeinstructions:
- "Clean the mushrooms using a knife. Do not wash the mushrooms, they will soak with water and become mushy. Cut onions and parsley."
- "Heat one tbsp butter in a pan and sauté onions until glossy. Remove from the pan and put in a small bowl. Bring water to a boil to cook the pasta al dente."
- "In the pan heat the second tbsp butter and sauté the mushrooms for 4 - 6 minutes then add the onions."
