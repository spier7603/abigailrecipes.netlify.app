recipeingredient:
- " Chicken"
- "2 boneless skinless chicken breasts"
- "1/4 cup cornstarch"
- "1/4 tsp. each salt and pepper"
- " Vegetable oil for frying"
- " Orange Sauce"
- "1/2 cup natural marmalade"
- "2 tbsp. low sodium soy sauce"
- "2 tsp. rice vinegar"
- "1/2 tsp. toasted sesame oil"
- "1 clove garlic minced"
- "Pinch salt and pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Start by placing some oil into a large, deep skillet just above medium heat. You want enough oil to coat the bottom of the skillet by about 1/4&#34; or so. While it heats up, cut the chicken into small, bite-sized chunks. Place them into a gallon sized Ziploc bag. Pour in the cornstarch, salt and pepper. Then seal the bag and shake it up to evenly coat the chicken."
- "In a small bowl, whisk together all the sauce ingredients and set it aside. Once the oil is hot, add the chicken to the skillet in a single layer... you might need to cook the chicken in batches. Fry for 5-6 minutes per side, until they are starting to brown and are cooked through. Remove them to a towel lined plate. Once all the chicken is cooked, empty the oil from the pan, wipe it out and return it to the burner."
- "Place the chicken back into the pan and pour the sauce over the top. Stir it to evenly coat the chicken. Let it come up to a simmer for a few minutes to thicken the sauce slightly, then serve."
