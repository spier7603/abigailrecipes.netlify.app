- "Roll dough (between 2 plastic wrap sheets) with rolling pin until disc is a rough circle and will fit on your cookie sheet. (If dough begins to get too warm, pop it in the fridge for 15 minutes or so)"
- "Place a sheet of parchment paper on your cookie sheet. Remove top sheet of plastic wrap and quickly flip your disc upside down onto your parchment. Now remove remaining sheet of plastic wrap."
- "Arrange pear slices in concentric circles working from the center outward. Remember rustic not prefect! Important: Leave about 2&#34; of dough around the edge."
- "Begin on one edge and fold over the 2&#34; of dough towards the center on top of the pears. Turn your galette about an 1/8th of a turn and fold that edge onto the pears. Continue this folding until the whole outer edge of dough is now folded onto the pears."
- "Dot the pears with chunks of the butter. Drizzle warmed (in microwave is fine) apricot jam on pear slices. (A dash of cinnamon too if you&#39;re in the mood)"
- "Lightly brush the top of your crust with egg wash. And bake for about an hour till crust is golden brown and pears are soft."
- "Remove from oven and allow to cool before eating. Take care when handling the crust it is flaky/ crumbly and oh so delicious."
- "Bon appetit! I hope you enjoy this French tart with your clann. Don&#39;t forget to post your pics too."
