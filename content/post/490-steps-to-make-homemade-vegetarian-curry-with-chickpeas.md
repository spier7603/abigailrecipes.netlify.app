recipeinstructions:

- "Mince the onion and garlic. Grate the ginger. Open the can of whole tomatoes. If using whole spices, crush and grind the spices at this stage."
- "Heat the olive oil (I used butter) in a sauce pan, add the ginger and cinnamon (I used 1 teaspoon cinnamon powder) and lightly sauté to bring out the fragrance."
- "Add the onion, then slowly sauté on low heat until translucent, just up to the point where they become browned. Remove the cinnamon stick."
- "Add the chickpeas, mix with the onion, then add about 100 g of the can of whole tomatoes (including the juice). Crush the tomatoes, then simmer on medium heat while stirring. If the water cooks off, add some of the boiled water from the chickpeas from Step 1."
- "Skim off the scum from the top, season with salt and pepper, add the curry powder and other spices, then simmer for about 30 minutes. Adjust the spice with pepper."
- "When the chickpeas can be crushed with chopsticks, and the onions have almost lost their shape, it is ready."
