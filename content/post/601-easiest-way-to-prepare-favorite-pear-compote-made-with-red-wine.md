recipeinstructions:
- "Peel the pears with a peeler and cut off a little piece of the bottoms to make them flat. This is so they will not fall down when they&#39;re done."
- "If you want to simmer pear halves, cut them in half lengthwise and use a teaspoon to remove the core. Cut the lemon into 5 mm round slices."
- "Add the red wine, water, and sugar to a pot and place over medium heat. Bring to a boil and melt the sugar."
- "Turn the heat to low and arrange the pears so they are covered by the liquid. If boiling the pears whole, the pears should be the right size so that they are just covered by the liquid."
- "Place the lemon slices and cinnamon stick on top of the pears and cover with a paper towel. Simmer for 1 hour, ladling the liquid over the pears from time to time."
- "Turn off the heat and remove the lemon, cinnamon, and paper towel. Let cool and put the pears in the refrigerator, still in the liquid, and leave in the refrigator overnight. These are delicious eaten with vanilla ice cream."
- "If simmering pear halves or quarters, simmer for about 30 minutes to 1 hour."
