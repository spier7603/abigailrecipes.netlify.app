- " lemon juice"
- " freshly grated nutmeg"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put pears in a large heavy bottomed pot. Add pineapple, lemon juice and nutmeg. Stir in sugar."
- "Bring the pears to a boil over medium high heat. Stir constantly so the pears wont burn on the bottom."
- "Once you&#39;ve reached a full boil, turn the heat down to medium low and continue to cook the pears for 2 to 3 hours stirring frequently. You want the pears to be the color and texture of honey. Just keep in mind that this recipe might be time consuming but the longer you cook the pears the thicker it gets and it&#39;s well worth the wait!"

Seal jars with lids and rings and put into a boiling water canner bath for 10 minutes.  Once done, remove jars from the water to a dry kitchen towel on the counter and allow to cool while hearing the seals of the jars pop!"
- "Enjoy this pear honey on toast, breads, biscuits, muffins, fruits, ect. Once the seal has been opened on the jars, store in the refrigerator until used. Enjoy!"
