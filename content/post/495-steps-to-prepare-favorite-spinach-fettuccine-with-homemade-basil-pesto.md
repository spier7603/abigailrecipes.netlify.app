recipeingredient:
- " Homemade Pesto"
- "30 g pine nuts"
- "100 g fresh basil"
- "70 g Grana Padano or parmesan"
- "8 g garlic roughly chopped"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) olive oil"
- " To assemble to dish"
- "200 g spinach fettuccine or your pasta of choice           see recipe"
- " salt and pepper to taste"
- " pine nuts for garnishing"
- " grated parmesan for garnishing"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a medium skillet, toast 40 g pine nuts over medium heat, stirring frequently (don’t let them burn!), until nice and fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour them into a bowl to cool for a few minutes. Reserve a few for garnishing."
- "Combine the basil, 30 g pine nuts, Grana Padano, garlic and salt in a food processor or blender. With the machine running, slowly drizzle in the olive oil. Continue processing until the mixture is well blended but still has some texture, pausing to scrape down the sides as necessary."
- "Taste, and adjust if necessary. Add a pinch of salt if the basil tastes too bitter or the pesto needs more zing. Add more Parmesan if you’d like a creamier/cheesier pesto. If desired, you can thin out the pesto with more olive oil."
- "Bring a big pot of salted water to a boil. Throw in your choice of pasta and cook for the appropriate length of time. Just before draining, scoop out 1 cup of of the pasta cooking water. Drain pasta in a colander, leave it for a minute."
- "Transfer pasta to a bowl (do not use pasta cooking pot, too hot). Add pesto and 1/4 cup of pasta water. Toss to coat pasta in pesto, adding more water if required to make pasta silky and saucy, rather than dry and sticky."
- "Taste, add more salt and pepper if desired. Serve immediately, garnished with freshly grated parmesan and the rest of the pine nuts. Enjoy."
