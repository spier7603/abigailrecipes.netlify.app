- "6 oz fresh pasta or 4oz dried pasta"
- "5 tbsp olive oil or more 2 tbs to taste"
- "1 large onion sliced"
- "1/2 cup uncooked green or brown lentils"
- "1 tbsp fresh parsley for garnish"
recipeinstructions:
- "Saute onions in 2 tbs olive oil. Cook 5 minutes with lid on, then reduce heat, remove lid and continue to caramelize."
- "Once brown and caramelized, remove from heat."
- "Use kitchen towel to spread out lentils and look for any stones."
- "Rinse lentils."
- "Put 2 cups of water in pot and bring to boil. Add lentils."
- "Boil for 2 to 3 minutes then turn down to simmer and cook until tender will depend on lentil. Some lentils will cook in only ten minutes, no soaking."
- "Once tender, drain and reserve the lentil water. (This yielded about 7 oz.)"
- "Add enough water to reserved liquid to equal 2 1/2 liters. Bring lentil water mixture to a boil and add salt 2 1/2 tsp sea salt. Add pasta. Cook until &#34;al dente&#34; (not fully cooked, but tender- should still see some white). Fresh pasta adds great flavor and texture!"
- "In the meantime, pour the rest of the oil in the bottom of serving bowl."
- "Mix the lentil and onions in bowl."
- "Combine the pasta and lentils with caramelized onions. Garnish with fresh parsley and pinch of pepper. Serve immediately."
- "15 minute variation: Use precooked lentils. Will not be as flavorful as cooking in lentil broth, but still an easy way to incorporate lentils in your diet."
- "Caramelized onions."
- "Add cooked lentils to caramelized onions and heat through. At same time, boil pasta in salted water, drain and combine. Note: Recipe inspired from Claudia Roden&#39;s Lentils with Pasta and caramelized onions. Her food is rustic, simple with Arabesque influences. I would highly recommend her recipes!"
