Roasted chickpeas is one of the most popular of recent trending foods on earth. It's easy, it is fast, it tastes yummy. It is enjoyed by millions daily. Roasted chickpeas is something that I've loved my whole life. They are nice and they look wonderful.

Unlike deep-fried chickpeas, oven-roasted chickpeas don&#39;t stay as crispy once they cool, so I recommend eating them while they&#39;re still warm from the oven for optimal crunchiness. Chickpeas are oven roasted and seasoned to taste for a delicious high fiber snack. When roasting chickpeas you definitely do not need this much olive oil! They still have all the protein and heartiness of regular chickpeas, but they&#39;ve become an irresistible salty, crunchy ingredient.


To get started with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can have roasted chickpeas using 5 ingredients and 7 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.
