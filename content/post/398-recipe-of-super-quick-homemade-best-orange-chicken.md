- "Make a slurry of the cornstarch and a little cold water, stir into the sauce and continue cooking for a few minutes. You may need to add another teaspoon of slurry -the goal is to thicken the sauce so it coats the back of a spoon"

- "And there you have it! There is plenty of sauce to both coat the chicken and have enough to drizzle over rice or noodles...ENJOY!! ❤️❤️"
