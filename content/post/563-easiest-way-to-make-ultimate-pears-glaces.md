- " Olive oil"
- " Pomegranate seeds optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "I used mini Seckel pears for this recipe that were about 5-6 cm long. The fruit is a bit denser than normal pears and a little firmer."
- "De-seed the pears and cut them into small pieces. *If they&#39;re mini sized then it&#39;s also fine to just cut them in half. If they&#39;re regular size then dice them or cut them into 7 mm slices. You can leave the skin on or off, either way is fine."
- "Heat a little oil up in either a small saucepan or a small frying pan with a lid. Add the pears and cook them over medium heat until browned."
- "Once browned, pour in the wine, close the lid and steam-simmer the pears over very low heat until soft. This should take 5-10 minutes depending on the size of the pear."
- "When the pears have softened to your taste, add the butter and sugar and heat them up over strong heat until a caramel forms. Mix this caramel together with the pears and this dish is ready."
- "If you have them, pomegranate seeds make a beautiful-looking topping. The sweet and sour flavour of the pomegranate and crunchy seeds go deliciously well with glacés."
