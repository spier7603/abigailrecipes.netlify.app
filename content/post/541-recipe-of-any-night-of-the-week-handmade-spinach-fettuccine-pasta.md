recipeinstructions:
- "Blanch the spinach leaves in a little boiling water. Drain well, squeeze out and purée."
- "Put all the ingredients in a large bowl and mix. If it&#39;s too floury and dry and won&#39;t come together to form dough, add a little water."
- "When the dough comes together, knead it while incorporating any flour left in the bowl."
- "Form the dough into a ball, and knead it 7-8 times in the bowl. (Put your weight on it using your left hand wrist, and fold it in half when it&#39;s flattened. Repeat pressing down on it and folding it.)"
- "When the dough is no longer floury and has an even texture, roll it into a ball again and put it into sturdy plastic bag. Rest the dough in the refrigerator for an hour."
- "Put the dough in the middle of the bag, and press it flat by stepping on it. When the dough has been flattened evenly, fold it in half and step on it to flatten it again. Repeat 5-6 times."
- "Roll the dough out with a pasta machine or a rolling pin and cut it up. (I used a juicer with a pasta attachment.)"
- "Bring plenty of water to a boil in a large pot and add 1 heaping tablespoon of salt. Put the pasta in while separating the strands. The pasta tends to stick so stir with chopsticks as soon as you put it in the pot. Boil for about 4 minutes."
- "Serve with your favorite sauce. I like to make a simple tomato sauce with tuna by sautéing garlic and red chili peppers in olive oil, and adding a can of tuna. Add a can of tomatoes and a bay leaf. Simmer to reduce, and season with salt and pepper."
