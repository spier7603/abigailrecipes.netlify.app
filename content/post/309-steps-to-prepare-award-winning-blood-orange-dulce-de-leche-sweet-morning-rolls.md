recipeinstructions:
- "In a mixing bowl combine the yeast, warm milk and water, and a pinch of sugar. Let sit for 5 min or until the yeast begins to bloom. Next add the sugar, softened butter, salt, and egg and stir to combine."
- "Begin adding the flour in batches, I try to sift in the flour and spices until a dough begins to form. Once the majority of the flour has been added, take the dough out of the mixing bowl and transfer it to a floured surface. Knead the dough for about 3-5 min or until smooth and elastic, adding more flour as needed."
- "Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl and cover with a towel and allow to rise in a warm place for about an hour and up to three."
- "Once risen, transfer to a lightly floured surface and roll the dough into a large rectangle. Take the softened butter and spread it across one side of the dough. Next spread the dulce de leche across that side. I have found the easiest way to do this is by piping the dulce de leche on - it allows it to spread the most evenly."
- "Sprinkle the brown sugar, then oranges, and the shredded coconut. I finish by sprinkling some cinnamon and cardamom on the very top. Roll the dough up along the long side of the rectangle to create a long roll."
- "With a sharp knife, slice 1 inch rounds of the dough and then transfer them to a greased baking dish. Space the rolls so they are not crowded and will still have some room to expand into each other."
- "If you are going to cook immediately, cover with a towel and place in a warm place to rise again for 45 min. Preheat the oven to 380° F. If you are saving the rolls to cook later, plastic wrap them and keep in the refrigerator for up to two days. Before baking, allow to rise in a warm place for an hour to an hour and a half."
- "Brush on an egg wash and bake for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown. Once cooled make an icing with 2 c of powdered sugar, a dash of vanilla, 2 tbsp melted butter, and 2 tbsp of milk or serve warm and buttered. Wrap them up and they can be eaten throughout the week, or all in one sitting as I have been known to do."
