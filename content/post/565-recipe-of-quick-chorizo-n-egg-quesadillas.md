recipeingredient:
- "1 stick chorizo sausage"
- "3 eggs"
- "8 flour tortillas"
- "2 cups shredded cheese"
- "1 tbsp chopped fresh cilantro"
- " Sour cream and hot sauce for dipping"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add chorizo to pan on medium heat. Use a spatula to work it as it cooks so it resembles ground beef. It comes in tube form but is very easy to work with. It&#39;s not as dense as standard sausages. Cook that for approx. 5 minutes (it cooks fast)"
- "Push the clocked chorizo to one side of the pan. Crack the 3 eggs into the open side of the pan. Begin scrambling them in the pan for a minute then begin to stir them into the sausage. Continue blending till none of the egg is runny. Again, it cooks fast so it&#39;ll probably only take a couple minutes. Remove mixture to a bowl."
- "Wipe out the pan with a paper towel. Take a tortilla, add a thin layer of shredded cheese, sprinkle some fresh cilantro on the cheese, add a layer of chorizo/egg and another layer of cheese. Leave about 1/2 inch space between ingredients and the edge of the tortilla. Put that directly in pan, tortilla side down, on low heat. Top with another tortilla. Cook for a few minutes while moving it around in the pan for an even cook. Flip. Repeat. Continue that process till all ingredients are used. Cut in half or quarters. 1 stick of sausage and 3 eggs gave me 4 quesadillas."
- "A dipping sauce is a good idea. I just mixed about 3 parts sour cream and 1 part hot sauce in a separate bowl. You can even throw a bit of the cilantro in that too. I always get the hot chorizo as opposed to the mild because cooking it with the egg cuts down a lot of the heat. Hence the hot sauce. Enjoy!"
