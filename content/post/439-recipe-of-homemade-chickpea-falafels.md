recipeingredient:
- "1 cup chickpeas rinsed and drained"
- "4 scallions"
- "2 cloves garlic"
- "1/2 cup chopped cilantro"
- "1/4 cup chopped mint"
- "1/4 cup chopped parsley"
- "1 teaspoon cumin"
- "1/2 teaspoon salt"
- "1/2 cup plain dried breadcrumbs"
- " oil to fry"
recipeinstructions:
- "If you use canned chickpeas, go ahead to rinse them all. If you use dried chickpeas, leave them in water overnight and rise them well before cooking."
- "Place the drained chickpeas, garlic and salt in a bowl of a food processor and press until blended and chopped into fine pieces."
- "Add parsley, mint, cilantro, cumin, and breadcrumbs (or panko) and press until blended well."
- "It&#39;s time to form balls! I used my hands to form them. You can do it as I did, but you can also use falafel spoon which is available at an Arabic market or just 2 spoons to form balls. I was able to make 16 falafels with this recipe."
- "A point is that it is better not to form a big ball because it can be broken while frying it."
- "Heat the oil high (any oil can work. I used vegi oil.) It should be high heat to make brownish good-looking falafels."
- "Place falafels into the oil and fry them until their surface turn into brown. I fried 4 pieces at once to avoid falafels from being broken."
- "Drain fried falafels on kitchen paper and ready to serve! (Please try hummus and tahini recipes as well and eat with your falafels. Shukran!!)"
