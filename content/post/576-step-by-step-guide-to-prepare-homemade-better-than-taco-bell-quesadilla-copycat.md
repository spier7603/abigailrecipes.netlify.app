recipeinstructions:
- "In a small bowl mix together all ingredients for quesadilla sauce until well combined. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour for flavors to blend."
- "Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add chicken and taco seasoning. Stir to coat and cook until chicken is cooked all the way through. Set aside. SHORTCUT: Use precooked chicken. Cube just under 1/2&#34; and just heat in skillet with seasoning until warmed through. This is one way I use up leftover rotisserie chicken!"
- "Heat a 12&#34; skillet over medium low heat (I moved my chicken to a bowl, and rinsed out and dried the skillet I used for it). When skillet is heated, brush one side of one flour tortilla with about a teaspoon of melted better. Place buttered side down in skillet."

- "Allow to cook opened until cheese begins to melt around the edges. Fold sauce half of tortilla on top of filling half. Gently press down on quesadilla with back of a spatula to squish everything together. Continue cooking on first side until cheese is melted, about 2 minutes. Carefully flip, press and cook 2 minutes more for a lightly golden finish on both sides (Longer for a darker finish if you want)."
- "Repeat with remaining ingredients for 4 quesadillas. As each is finished, transfer from skillet to a plate to rest a few minutes before cutting. Cut each quesadilla into 4 pieces (I used my pizza cutter), serve and enjoy!"
