- "  14 tsp whole milk or lowfat"
- " vanilla bean extract"
- " butter"
- " Apple Filling"
- " mediumsized red apples"
- " butter"
- " white sugar"
- " light brown sugar"

recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 200 degrees Celsius. (400 degrees Fahrenheit)"
- "Let’s make the crust. First, combine all the dry ingredients in a medium-size bowl and whisk together."
- "Next, add in the 1/3 cup of butter and combine with your fingers until crumbly."
- "In a small separate bowl, mix the milk and vanilla bean extract together."
- "Slowly pour the milk mixture into the bowl of dry ingredients. Use your hands to form a ball of dough."
- "Once there is no remaining flour in the bowl, take the dough out and wrap in Saran wrap and chill in the fridge for 20 minutes."
- "Now let’s move on to the apple filling. First, peel your apples and then cut them into cheeks. (Cheeks are slices of the apple that are cut thinly.)"
- "Put the cheeks into a medium-sized bowl, then add the white sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon; mix well with your hands."
- "In a large pan, turn the heat on medium-low and add the 2 tbsp butter; let it melt. Once the butter has melted, add the apples and cook for 3 minutes, or until they are soft. Set aside in a bowl."
- "Take the dough out of the fridge and cut in half."
- "Roll out your dough and using a large circular cookie cutter, cut out your mini pie crust. (If you don’t have a large circular cookie cutter on hand, I actually use a glass cup to cut my dough out.) Roll out the mini pie crusts until you reach your desired thickness."
- "Place the dough into a cupcake mold or tin that’s been lightly coated with olive oil spray, or greased with butter. If you are baking with a silicone cupcake mold, like I did, you don’t need to spray or grease it. Use a fork and prick the bottom of the crust 3 times. Bake for 15 minutes."
- "After 15 minutes, take the crust out of the oven and add the apples. You can lay the apples down inside, filling the crust, or do a rose pattern, which is what I do to make it look more attractive."
- "To make a rose pattern take a slice of apple and push against the side of the dough and begin doing a spiral until you’ve filled the pie crust with apples. Bake for another 10 minutes."
- "Pair with whipped cream and caramel sauce, or with powdered sugar and vanilla ice cream!"

##### Steps to make Mini Rose Apple Pies:

1. Preheat oven to 200 degrees Celsius. (400 degrees Fahrenheit)
1. Let’s make the crust. First, combine all the dry ingredients in a medium-size bowl and whisk together.
1. Next, add in the 1/3 cup of butter and combine with your fingers until crumbly.
1. In a small separate bowl, mix the milk and vanilla bean extract together.
1. Slowly pour the milk mixture into the bowl of dry ingredients. Use your hands to form a ball of dough.
1. Once there is no remaining flour in the bowl, take the dough out and wrap in Saran wrap and chill in the fridge for 20 minutes.
1. Now let’s move on to the apple filling. First, peel your apples and then cut them into cheeks. (Cheeks are slices of the apple that are cut thinly.)
1. Put the cheeks into a medium-sized bowl, then add the white sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon; mix well with your hands.
1. In a large pan, turn the heat on medium-low and add the 2 tbsp butter; let it melt. Once the butter has melted, add the apples and cook for 3 minutes, or until they are soft. Set aside in a bowl.
1. Take the dough out of the fridge and cut in half.
1. Roll out your dough and using a large circular cookie cutter, cut out your mini pie crust. (If you don’t have a large circular cookie cutter on hand, I actually use a glass cup to cut my dough out.) Roll out the mini pie crusts until you reach your desired thickness.
1. Place the dough into a cupcake mold or tin that’s been lightly coated with olive oil spray, or greased with butter. If you are baking with a silicone cupcake mold, like I did, you don’t need to spray or grease it. Use a fork and prick the bottom of the crust 3 times. Bake for 15 minutes.
1. After 15 minutes, take the crust out of the oven and add the apples. You can lay the apples down inside, filling the crust, or do a rose pattern, which is what I do to make it look more attractive.
1. To make a rose pattern take a slice of apple and push against the side of the dough and begin doing a spiral until you’ve filled the pie crust with apples. Bake for another 10 minutes.
1. Pair with whipped cream and caramel sauce, or with powdered sugar and vanilla ice cream!
