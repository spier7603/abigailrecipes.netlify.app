recipeinstructions:
- "Start with oiling the pan then sweating the minced garlic.  Season lightly with salt and pepper."
- "After about 2 minutes add the prawns and pepper flakes and let them cook on high heat just to give it color on both sides. Don&#39;t fully cook them yet, we just want some color. It should take 2-3 minutes."
- "Once they have some color start removing them and set aside onto a plate."

- "Taste the sauce and season with salt and pepper if needed.  If you cook the shrimp right they will have a nice crunch to them.  Serve it as it is or over your favorite pasta.  It also goes nicely with some warm crusty bread. Enjoy!"
