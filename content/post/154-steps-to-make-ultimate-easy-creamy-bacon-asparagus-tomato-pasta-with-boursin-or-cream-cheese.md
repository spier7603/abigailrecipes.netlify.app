recipeingredient:
- "8 oz pasta of choice boiled al dente and drained I used spaghetti this time"
- " olive oil"
- "5 slices bacon cut into 13 pieces"
- "1/2 pound asparagus woody part snapped off and cut into 15inch pieces"
- "1 pint fresh cherry or grape tomatoes halved OR 1 15 oz can diced tomatoes drained"
- "1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley OR 1 to 2 Tablespoons dried"
- "3 cloves garlic finely chopped"
- "1 Tablespoon lemon juice"
- "3-4 Tablespoons Boursin any flavor or cream cheese"
- " salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large frying pan, bring 1/2 Tablespoon olive oil up to medium heat, add bacon to the pan, and render the bacon to your desired doneness. I like to render it about a third and still have some pork fat left on the bacon pieces."
- "Turn heat to high, add asparagus, and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally."
- "Add another 1 Tablespoon of olive oil, add tomatoes, and cook the tomatoes for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Don&#39;t fear the high heat - the liquid and volume of the asparagus and tomatoes will keep things from burning."
- "Add garlic and three-quarters of the parsley, stir to incorporate, and cook until garlic is translucent."
- "Add pasta, lemon juice, and cheese, and stir or toss everything together. Give the cheese a minute or so to melt, stirring a couple of times in the process.   At this point, you&#39;ll want to salt to taste. I used about 1/2 teaspoon. Didn&#39;t need much because of the salt from the bacon and the cheese."
- "When the cheese is melted, give everything another gentle toss to make sure all the ingredients are incorporated, sprinkle the rest of the parsley on top, and enjoy! :)"
