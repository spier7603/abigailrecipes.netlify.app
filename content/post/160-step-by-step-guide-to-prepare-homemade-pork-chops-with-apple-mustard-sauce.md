- " ribend bonein pork chops about 34 cm thick"
- " shallot finely chopped"
- " brandy"
- " pure unsweetened apple juice"
- " chicken stock"
- " fresh thyme sprigs"
- " Dijon mustard"
- " unsalted butter"
- " sweet apple I used ambrosia peeled and chopped"
recipeinstructions:
- "Season the chops with salt and pepper. Cut nicks into the fat every few centimeters; this will help keep the chops from curling. Add a small splash of olive oil and a tbsp of butter to a medium pan on medium-high heat. Sear the chops for 3 minutes per side until cooked and golden. Set them aside on a plate to rest, tented loosely with foil."
- "Add the shallots to the pan and let them fry for 1 minute. Carefully add the brandy. Let reduce until only a tbsp or so of liquid remains. Add the apple juice, chicken stock, thyme sprigs, and mustard and bring to a simmer. Season with a pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper, and cook until reduced by half. This&#39;ll take 10 to 15 minutes."
- "Strain the sauce into another pan and put it on low heat. Whisk in the 2 tbsp unsalted butter, a little at a time, to thicken and enrichen the sauce. Return the chops and any juices to the pan to re-warm them."
- "Add a knob of butter to a skillet on medium-high heat. Once the butter&#39;s melted, browned, and bubbling, add the apple chunks. Leave them alone for a minute to sear, then give the skillet a shake. Season lightly with a pinch of salt. Leave the apples to cook another minute, then take them off the heat. They should look caramelized but not mushy. Individually or family-style, plate the chops, topped with the fried apples, and drizzled with the mustard sauce."
