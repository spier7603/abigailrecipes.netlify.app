- "Place drained noodles and clams in your simmering sauce. Mix well. Keep covered for two minutes. Add additional clam juice again if your sauce appears too thick due to the noodle absorption. She will thicken up with sit time."
- "Mix with forks. Lift and seperate your noodles to fully incorporate them."
- "If using raw clams, scrub your shells and pull any beards. In a separate pan, place your butter and white wine. Bring to a simmer. Add your shelled clams and tightly cover. Simmer until all clams have opened. About 3 minutes if raw. If any do not open, disgard them. They&#39;re bad. If employing pre-steamed, steam for 1 minute or until heated."
- "A, &#34;stand alone,&#34; presentation by one of my newer, less adventurous students who just couldn&#39;t bring herself to eat or even touch actual shellfish. ;0)"
- "Serve pasta hot with warm fresh bread and butters to the side. Garnish dish with steamed clams, fresh parsley and shreaded Parmasean cheese. Enjoy!"
