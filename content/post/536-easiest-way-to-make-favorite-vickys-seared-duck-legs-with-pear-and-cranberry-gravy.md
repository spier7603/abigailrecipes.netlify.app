recipeingredient:
- " duck legs skin on"
- " salt"
- " ground black pepper"
- " olive oil"
- " shallots finely chopped"
- " garlic finely chopped"
- " white wine"
- " balsamic vinegar"
- " strong chicken stock  you may need more or less depending on the size of your pot"
- " sprigs of thyme"
- " bay leaf"
- " dried cranberries"
- " pears peeled and cubed"
- " sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Score the fat on the duck legs - cut 3 lines one way and 3 intersecting lines the other way so you end up with a diamond pattern. Don&#39;t cut into the meat, only score the fat. Rub some salt and pepper all over the legs and a little olive oil"
- "In a heavy-bottomed pot, cook the duck legs, skin/fat side down until crisp and browned, about 4 - 6 minutes. Turn over and brown on the other side for 2 minutes. There will be fat released from the duck legs in the pan now. Remove the legs and allow to rest on a plate for a few moments"
- "Add the garlic and shallots to the duck fat in the pan and allow to cook for one minute. Pour in the wine and balsamic vinegar. Scrape up the bits off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon and allow the liquid to boil and reduce for a minute or two"
- "Add in the thyme sprigs, bay leaf, chopped pears and cranberries and stir together. Put the duck back into the pan, skin side up, along with any juices from the resting plate"
- "Add the stock, but don&#39;t allow the liquid level to go above the duck legs or else you&#39;ll end up with soggy skin instead of it being nice and crispy. Bring to a boil and then lower to a gentle simmer. Cook at a low simmer for 90 minutes uncovered"
- "Remove the legs and skim as much of the fat off the top of the gravy as you can– a lot will have risen to the top"
- "Press the sauce through a sieve and mash down the  pear, garlic and shallots to get as much of the flavor out as possible. Return the gravy to the pot and boil for 3 minutes to thicken it. Add a bit of sugar if it&#39;s too bitter for your taste and skim any more fat off the top"
- "Plate the duck with the gravy and some mash or roasted potatoes. I also served with balsamic roasted pears, recipe link below  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/349562-vickys-balsamic-roast-pears"
