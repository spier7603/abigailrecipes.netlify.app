recipeinstructions:

- "Remove chicken from refrigerator.  Melt butter in skillet over low heat.  Add remaining salt and distribute evenly in pan.  Add chicken and discard liquid from storage container."

Fold over and continue cooking until both sides have crisped(I like mine slightly burnt) and cheese is melted.  Enjoy!"
