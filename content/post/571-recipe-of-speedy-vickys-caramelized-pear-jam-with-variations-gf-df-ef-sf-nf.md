recipeingredient:
- " Basic Pear Jam"
- "2500 grams pears peeled cored and roughly chopped"
- "800 grams white granulated sugar"
- "120 ml lemon juice"
- "6 tbsp pear juice"
- " Spiced Pear Jam"
- "1 tsp ground cinnamon"
- "1/2 tsp ground cloves"
- " Vanilla Pear Jam"
- "2 vanilla pods seeds scraped and added to the pan"
- " Cardamom Pear Jam"
- "1 tbsp crushed green cardamom powder"
- " Ginger Pear Jam"
- "40 grams (1/4 cup) chopped candied  crystallized ginger"
- "1 1/2 tsp fresh grated ginger"
- "1/2 tsp lemon zest"
- " Rosemary Pear Jam"
- "240 ml (1 cup) honey in place of 200g 1 cup of the sugar"
- "2 tsp lemon zest"
- "2 tsp fresh snipped rosemary leaves"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add all of the ingredients for the base recipe plus whichever flavourings you choose into a heavy bottomed pan and bring to a rolling boil"
- "Turn the heat down a little and let simmer for 1.5 - 2 hours until thickened, stirring often and skimming off the top as required"
- "Mash the pear chunks down a little with a potato masher or use a stick blender to carefully puree 1/3 of the mixture"
- "The jam is fine left like this and will be a pretty amber colour. To take it a step further, caramelize it by turning up the heat and watching it without stirring until it darkens. Be careful not to take it too far or it will be burnt jam rather than caramelized"
- "Test the set by pouring a little onto a cool saucer and pushing the jam with your finger. If the surface wrinkles it&#39;s ready to jar. If not, keep simmering but test every 20 minutes"
- "Pour into warm, sterilized jars, stopping 1/4 inch from the top. I use jars from old store bought jam, half pint sized jars"
- "Put a wax paper or parchment paper disc on top as pictured above then screw the lids straight on and let sit on a tea towel or wire rack until cooled to room temperature. They will self seal as they cool"
- "Keep in a cupboard until opened, then refrigerate and use within 6 weeks"
- "Yields 6 x half pint jars so serving size noted is per jar"
- "Delicious on toast and actually goes nicely with pork and ham"
- "If you swap out some pears and add apple you get a lovely pear &amp; apple preserves recipe. I use 70% pears to 30% apples and use apple juice instead of pear juice. That works out to 1750g pears and 750g apples and goes great with the spiced recipe and the vanilla one"
