- "Using a large sauce pan with the flame on medium, add just enough olive oil to bottom of pan to sauteed ingredients."
- "Add minced garlic cloves and let it cook alone. Just until you smell the aroma in the air. Be careful not to burn, garlic cooks quickly."
- "Now add the white wine and let cook for about 3 minutes. Add butter. When melted add your orange pepper slivers and cook for about 4-5 minutes. You still want your veggies to have a little bite to them. You can now add your lemon zest and fresh lemon juice to the pan."

- "Last add the chopped parsley on top the pasta. Walla, Perfection!"
