Ingredients: Farfalle pasta: I have a strong preference towards farfalle, but that doesn&#39;t mean you have to use it! Feel free to use penne, elbow noodles, or fusilli instead. Rigatoni could work in a pinch, but I find noodles with crevices shine best in pasta salad. Toss hot pasta with sauteed garlic and scallions; add chopped tomatoes, mozzarella, Parmesan, basil and olives. Garden fresh basil and summer sweet cherry tomatoes make this pasta salad a warm season favorite.
